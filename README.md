## Description

ardoq_archimate is a tool for importing archimate models to [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com).


## Documentation

Implemented:

## Limitations / Issues
- Location not implemented. Waiting for Ardoq to include it in the template

## Installation

`pip install ardoqarchimate`

## Dependencies

- python3
- [ardoqpy](https://github.com/jbaragry/ardoq-python-client) - for integration with ardoq
- [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) - for reading and writing xml

## Quick Start
To get started from an IDE

    clone the repo
    clone the ardoqpy project
    adjust your python path to include ardoqpy
    edit the config file to use your API key
    edit the config file to point to the archimate exchange file

## Version

- 2016/04 - Initial version from archimate 2.1 to my own archimate 2.1 model
- 2016/11 - Refactored version to import archimate 2.1 to the official ardoq archimate 3 template/model

## TODO
- Make config file available as a cmd line param
- import archimate 3 exchange file once the spec if updated
- make the tool easier for non-programmers to use
    - perhaps solution in AWS lamda to provide archimate import as a service to Ardoq
